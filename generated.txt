Here is a sample Python code I found:
Python code and example to demonstrate how to work with the two sets of parameters. I’ll start by writing a quick demo and then show you the code by looking at the code you’ve posted. I’ll show you how to find out how to create a Python program and how to create a simple Python statement.
